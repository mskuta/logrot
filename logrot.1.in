.SH DESCRIPTION
.I logrot
rotates the log file
.IR "file" ,
creating a new log file with the same permissions
as the original.
If necessary, the rotated file may be pre-processed with
.IR "preprocessor" ,
filtered via
.IR "filter" ,
compressed with
.IR "compressor" ,
and post-processed with
.IR "postprocessor" .
.PP
.I logrot
attempts to rotate the file as atomically as possible,
so that the time window in which
.I file
doesn't exist is minimised.
.PP
A signal
.I sig
can be sent to a process id stored in
.IR "pidfile" ,
or
.I notify_command
can be run to perform any other form of notification.
After that, a time delay of
.I wait
seconds will occur before any filtering is performed - giving
the logging process time to re-open the new logfile on receipt
of the signal.
.PP
The name of the rotated file can be configured by specifying
the format string
.IR "rotatefmt" ,
and the target directory is
given in
.IR "destdir" .
.SH OPTIONS
.I logrot
accepts the following options (in the following list,
.I rotfile
is the name of the rotated file):
.TP 8
.B \-B, \-\-prerotate \fIpreprocessor\fR
Preprocess
.I rotfile
with
.I "preprocessor"
before the filtering and compression occurs, but after rotation.
The
.B "%"
character allows for escape sequences, a la
.IR "printf" (3).
The following escape sequences are supported:
\`%%\' - a \`%\' sign.
\`%d\' \-
.IR "dirname" (1)
of
.IR "rotfile" .
\`%f\' \-
.IR "basename" (1)
of
.IR "rotfile" .
\`%p\' \-
full pathname of
.IR "rotfile" .
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-compress
Compress data before storing in
.I rotfile.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-compresscmd \fIcompressor\fR
Use
.I compressor
as the compression program for
.BR "\-c" .
Defaults to
\`!GZIP!\'.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-olddir \fIdestdir\fR
Store
.I rotfile
in
.IR "destdir" .
Defaults to the current directory of the logfile.
.TP
.B \-f \fIfilter\fR
Filter
.I file
through
.I filter
before optional compression and output to
.IR "rotfile" .
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-postrotate \fIpostprocessor\fR
Postprocess
.I rotfile
with
.IR "postprocessor" .
Accepts the same
.B "%"
escape sequences as
.BR \-B .
.TP
.B \-N \fInotify_command\fR
Execute 
.I notify_command
instead of sending a signal.
This option overrides any preceeding
.B \-s
option.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpidfile\fR
Contains the pid of the process to signal with
.BI \-s " sig"
when the rotation has occurred.
The first word on the first line of
.I pidfile
is assumed to be the pid.
Defaults to \`!PIDFILE!\'.
If no signal is to be sent, use
.B \-s
0.
.TP
.B \-r \fIrotatefmt\fR
Format of rotated filename, which is relative to 
.B \-d\c
.IR "\ destdir" .
Escape characters a la
.IR "printf" (3)
are available; refer to
.B "ROTATE FORMAT ESCAPE SEQUENCES"
below for more information.
Defaults to \`%f.%y%m%d\'.
.TP
.B \-s \fIsig\fR
The signal to send to the process defined in
.I pidfile
before waiting for 
.I wait
seconds to expire.
May be one of
.IR "HUP" ,
.IR "INT" ,
.IR "QUIT" ,
.IR "TERM" ,
.IR "USR1" ,
or
.IR "USR2" .
Defaults to
.IR "HUP" .
If
.I sig
is \`0\', then don't send a signal to
.IR "pidfile" .
This option overrides any preceeding
.B \-N
option.
.TP
.B \-w \fIwait\fR
Seconds to wait after sending the 
.I sig
signal
or running
.I notify_command
before performing any further processing.
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-compressext \fIcompressext\fR
Extension to append to
.I rotfile
if compression occurred.
Defaults to \`.gz\'.
.SS ROTATE FORMAT ESCAPE SEQUENCES
.I rotatefmt
(as given by
.IR rotatefmt )
can have escape sequences with
.B "%"
a la
.IR "printf" (3).
All of the date/time escapes are generated with the same named sequence from
.IR "strftime" (3).
.PP
The following escape sequences are available:
.TP 6
.B %%
A \`%\' sign.
.TP
.B %f
The
.IR "basename" (1)
of
.IR "file" .
.TP
.B %y
Current year within century (e.g, 97).
.TP
.B %Y
Current year, including century (e.g, 1997)
.TP
.B %m
Current month, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 02)
.TP
.B %d
Current day, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 27)
.TP
.B %H
Current hour (24-hour clock), with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 23)
.TP
.B %M
Current minute, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 09)
.TP
.B %S
Current second, with leading 0 if necessary (e.g., 42)
.SH DIAGNOSITICS
.I logrot
will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
.B 0
No error occurred.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred after the rotation occurred but before the
filtering completed successfully.
A temporary file of the
form \`\fIfile\fR.logrot.XXXXXX\' (where \`XXXXXX\' is replaced
with a random number) will remain in the filesystem.
This is not removed to allow manual rotation to occur.
.TP
.B 2
An error occurred but no temporary file exists.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 22
.B !PIDFILE!
Contains the pid of the process to signal after rotation.
